# [Beach Bots 18253](https://www.instagram.com/beachbotsftc/?hl=en) Code Documentation

This repository holds some of the documentation for the code I programmed for the 2021-2022 [FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). This repository does not contain the entire code for the robot but rather highlights some interesting features.

We faced some challenges throughout the year, and so our team did not end up qualifying for the 2021-2022 World Championship. (Though we did win the Innovate Award at the Los Angeles FTC Qualifier Event.) Our team also participated in the [Maryland Tech Invitational](https://sites.google.com/view/mdtechinvitational/home) but, due to a combination of last minute mechanical and software issues, we did not perform as well as we would have liked.

Either way, I really enjoyed my time working on the Beach Bots robotics team. It was an eye-opening experience and I truly learned a lot. I'd like to thank my teammates, sponsors, and everyone else who helped along the way!
