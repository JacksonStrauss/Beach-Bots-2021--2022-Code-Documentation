## Finite State Machine

When working with a system that needs to perform a certain set of tasks at one point in time and then switch to a different behavior later on, it can become complicated to create and manage these different "states" in which the system runs. A way to simplify this process is to implement a framework called a [Finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) which makes it much easier for the programmer to create distinct "states" that the program can switch between for different behaviors.
